> A marathon is just a half marathon with a 10k warmup and cooldown.

When I moved to Blacksburg in the fall of 2024 to start my PhD, I was excited, nervous, and completely unsure of what the next few years would look like. But not long after I arrived, I started running — at first, just to explore the beautiful hills and parks in my neighbourhood and to stay fit. I didn’t expect to fall in love with it, or with this town.

Blacksburg has a way of pulling you in with its quiet charm, winding trails, and breathtaking views. Running became more than just a way to stay active, it became my way of connecting with this new place and staying locked in. I am quite fortunate and grateful to have found an amazing group of people who share my love for running. I’m still a beginner, both in running and in my PhD journey, but with each mile and each semester, I’m hoping to get a little stronger, a little faster, and a little more at home. 

I hope to track my running progress by keeping track of some of the milestones in my running journey.

- November 2024 – Went on my first run (0.6 miles)
