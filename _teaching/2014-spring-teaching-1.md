I was the GTA for the CMDA 2006 course during the Fall 2024, Spring 2025 semesters. My responsibilities across the two semesters included making rubrics for the homeworks, correcting homeworks, holding office hours, proctoring exams and I even led a couple of lectures across these two semesters. During this period I also completed the teaching certification offered by the department of mathematics at Virginia Tech.
